1) Trajectory length or no of frames
2) Number of atoms
3) Trajectory file name and location (input file). Only xyz file format is accepted
4) Number of strings (or words) in the second line of the xyz file 
5) dipole moment and bond polarisability file name and location (output file)
6) Length of the simulation box in x, y and z direction. PBC applied in x- and y-
   directions, while free boundary condition is applied in z-direction, i.e., the
   surface direction.
7) Time step in femtosecond
8) Time correlation function length (standard length is 1 ps). Larger tcfl will
   lead to stastical uncertainties in the SFG spectra. Choose the optimum value. 
9) cross-correlation cut off (standard cut-off is 6 angstrom) If you want
   to include only the intra-cross correlation, that is within a water molecule
   use only 2 angstrom.   
10) SFG spectrum file name and location (output file). Quantum correction factor
   and non-condon approximation are not included. Include explicitly. For
   more information and simulation details, please check the following articles
   https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4931106 and
   https://doi.org/10.1080/00268976.2019.1620358 (<-see Supplementary information)
11) Auto Intra-cross Inter-cross correlation. 1->will include the correlation 
   0->will turn off the correlations. Even though cross correlations are                                               
   essential to reproduce the experimental SFG measurements, in practice it is 
   neglected due convergence issues and insufficient trajectories. 
12) Surface region on the top side of the interface
13) Surface region on the bottom side of the interface
