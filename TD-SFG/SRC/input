1) Trajectory length or no of frames
2) Number of atoms
3) Trajectory file name and location (input file). Only xyz file format is accepted
4) Number of strings (or words) in the second line of the xyz file 
5) dipole moment and bond polarisability file name and location (output file)
6) Length of the simulation box in x, y and z direction. PBC applied in x- and y-
   directions, while free boundary condition is applied in z-direction, i.e., the
   surface direction.
7) Time step in femtosecond
8) vibrational frequencies of the OH modes, which are determined from
   empirical maps or a short-time wavelet transform (input file).
9) Time correlation function length (standard length is 1 ps). Larger tcfl will
   lead to stastical uncertainties in the SFG spectra. Choose the optimum value. 
10) SFG spectrum file name and location (output file). Quantum correction factor
   and non-condon approximation are not included. Include explicitly. For
   more information and simulation details, please check the following articles
   https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4931106 and
   https://doi.org/10.1080/00268976.2019.1620358 (<-see Supplementary information)
11) Surface region on the top side of the interface
12) Surface region on the bottom side of the interface
13) T_w - time delay in fms.
